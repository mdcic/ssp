System Service Processor communication library is a module for python that
implements a set of operation with common system's service processors. It
can be used in various areas from HA clustering (fencing agents) to HPC
and datacenter management systems. E.g. where there is a need to control
computer systems remotely. There are four major functions:
 -discovery SP on the network,
 -probbing for SP type,
 -collecting vital SP and system(s) data,
 -issuing commands to specific SP.
